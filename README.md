1. Assumptions
    - I imagine the CombinedLetters folder wouldn't reside within the application but for simplicity I put it inside the project folder. 
    - I assumed that archiving the files implies moving the day's folder to archive from both Admission and Scholarship, thus when the service runs only the days needing to be processed will be in the respective folders.
    - I would assume that once two files were combined that the individual one should be deleted so they are not processed (mailed) individually, but I did not implement that for simplicity.
